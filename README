# Explode MKV

This tool accepts an mkv file as an input and extracts each individual track into a separate file.
All the extracted files are saved in a directory named after the file.
Alongside each stream file, a YAML document is also written out with some properties.
If the stream is an audio or video stream, a timecode file is also extracted to preserve the sync information.

## Usage

In the simplest case, simply call the `explodeMKV` script with one or more MKV files as inputs.
Ensure that the current directory is writable and has enough space.

    $ explodeMKV.rb original-file.mkv
    $ ls original-file-20150101T0000/
    0-video
    0-video.txt
    0-video.yaml
    1-audio-eng
    1-audio.eng.txt
    1-audio-eng.yaml
    2-subtitles-eng
    2-subtitles-eng.yaml

If needed, the `-o/--output` option may be used to designate a different path where the directory and its contents should be written to.
